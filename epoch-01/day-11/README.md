# Day 11: Compare accounts vs databases

## Lessons learned:
- Solana blockchain stores data and manages authentication and access very differently than trad databases.

|Concept      |Traditional Databases|Solana Account|
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
|Data Location|Rows in tables on a centralized server|Accounts on a distributed ledger accros validators|
|Schema|Defined by the database (jjSQL DDL, document schema)|Defined by the owning program; stored as raw bytes in the account's `data` field|
|Access control|Application-level auth (SQL roles, app middleware)|Enforced by the runtime: only the owning program can modify an account, and only with the required signer(s)|
|Cost of storage|Server/cloud hosting fees, pay for disk space|Rent-exempt deposit proportional to data size (query via solana rent); refundable when the account is closed|
|Identity/keys|Auto-increment IDs, UUIDs|32-byte public keys or Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)|
|Reads|SQL queries, document lookups|RPC calls (getAccountInfo, getProgramAccounts)|
|Writes|INSERT/UPDATE via application code|Transactions with instructions, signed by authorized keys|
|Code vs data|Application code and database are separate systems|Both are accounts; programs (code) and data accounts coexist in the same model|
|Deletion|DELETE query removes the row|Close the account, lamports are returned to you|
|Visibility|Private by default; you choose what to expose|Public by default; anyone can read any account’s data|
